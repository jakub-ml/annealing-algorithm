# Project: Pallet Loading Optimization in a Warehouse
### Problem Introduction
The goal of the project is to optimize the process of loading a custom pallet with grocery products in a warehouse.
The worker must quickly collect products from shelves while being limited by a maximum carrying capacity of 30 kg and mandatory breaks after every 5,000 steps (each break lasting 2 minutes).
The objective is to maximize work efficiency by planning the most effective movement path.

### Task Description
* Maximum carrying weight: 30 kg

* Breaks: Every 5,000 steps – 2-minute break

* Product collection rules:

    * The worker can carry products from multiple shelves simultaneously (as long as the weight limit is not exceeded).

    * The worker operates continuously except for the mandatory breaks.

    * Carried products are placed onto the pallet immediately after pickup.

    * All shelves have the same priority.

    * The weight carried does not affect movement speed.

    * Travel time between any two objects (shelves, pallet) is constant.

### Warehouse Map Layout
The project assumes a simplified warehouse map showing the placement of shelves and the pallet.
Movement between objects always takes the same amount of time, regardless of distance.

### Simplifications
* No products exceed the worker’s maximum carrying capacity.

* Movement speed is not affected by the carried weight.

* Constant time for traveling between any two objects.

* No additional breaks other than the ones required after 5,000 steps.

### Theory: Simulated Annealing
* The optimization algorithm uses Simulated Annealing – a metaheuristic inspired by the process of annealing metals.

* Temperature: A parameter controlling the randomness of solution modifications; it decreases over time.

* Iterative Process: In each iteration, a new solution is generated by modifying the previous one.

* Acceptance of Worse Solutions: There is a probability of accepting worse solutions to avoid getting stuck in local maxima.

* Boltzmann Distribution Formula: The probability of accepting a worse solution
